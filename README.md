# My advent of code 2023

My solutions to the Advent of Code of 2023 in C++. This is my first year doing AoC, so I haven't any snippet for the input nor anything like that.

Some of the days have only the solutions of part 2, as I wrote it over the part 1 solutions.

When a day day has two solutions is because the part 1 and part 2 solutions are very different, and *usually (not always)* the code for part two is better than the part 1.

I haven't uploaded the inputs as mentioned in the [AoC web](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)
